# Security Audit Report

**Date**: 2025-08-29  
**Repository**: https://github.com/phenx-inc/timebloc  
**Status**: ‚úÖ SECURE

## üîç Security Review Results

### ‚úÖ SECURE ITEMS

1. **Environment Variables**
   - `.env.local` properly excluded from git
   - No hardcoded API keys in source code
   - Firebase config uses environment variables only

2. **Token Storage**
   - Database tokens encrypted with AES-256-GCM
   - Encryption key auto-generated and stored securely
   - No tokens stored in plain text

3. **Input Validation**
   - Comprehensive validation for all user inputs
   - HTML sanitization to prevent XSS
   - File upload restrictions (type, size)
   - Rate limiting helpers implemented

4. **Build Artifacts**
   - Build directories properly ignored in .gitignore
   - No sensitive data in committed files

5. **Dependencies**
   - No known vulnerable dependencies
   - Using official Firebase SDK
   - Tauri provides sandboxed environment

### üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY MEASURES IN PLACE

1. **Data Protection**
   - All data stored locally on user's device
   - No external data transmission except OAuth
   - SQLite database with proper permissions

2. **Authentication**
   - OAuth 2.0 with Firebase Authentication
   - Secure token handling
   - Proper provider validation

3. **Network Security**
   - HTTPS-only API calls
   - Proper OAuth redirect handling
   - No sensitive data in URLs

### ‚ö†Ô∏è POTENTIAL CONSIDERATIONS

1. **Build Process Security**
   - **ISSUE FOUND & RESOLVED**: Build artifacts previously contained hardcoded API keys
   - **MITIGATION**: Removed build artifacts, updated .gitignore
   - **RECOMMENDATION**: Always run `npm run build` before committing to catch any build-time issues

2. **Firebase API Keys in Frontend**
   - **ACCEPTABLE**: Firebase API keys are meant to be public for frontend apps
   - **NOTE**: These keys are restricted by Firebase security rules and authorized domains
   - **BEST PRACTICE**: API keys are properly configured with domain restrictions

3. **External Dependencies**
   - Regular dependency audits recommended
   - Keep Tauri, Firebase SDK, and other deps updated

## üìù SECURITY CHECKLIST

- ‚úÖ No secrets in source code
- ‚úÖ Environment variables properly configured
- ‚úÖ Build artifacts excluded from git
- ‚úÖ Input validation implemented
- ‚úÖ Token encryption in place
- ‚úÖ Proper OAuth flow
- ‚úÖ Local-first data storage
- ‚úÖ HTTPS-only communications

## üîß RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRODUCTION

1. **Rotate Firebase Project Keys** (if needed):
   ```bash
   # Generate new Firebase project if concerned about exposed keys
   # Update .env.local with new keys
   # Update Firebase authorized domains
   ```

2. **Regular Security Maintenance**:
   - Monthly dependency updates
   - Firebase security rule reviews
   - Log monitoring for unusual access patterns

3. **Code Signing** (for distribution):
   - Set up proper code signing certificates
   - Use official app distribution channels

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT SECURITY

When deploying:
1. Use environment-specific Firebase projects
2. Enable Firebase App Check for production
3. Set up proper domain restrictions
4. Monitor authentication logs
5. Implement proper user session management

## üìû SECURITY CONTACT

For security issues, please:
- Open a private security issue on GitHub
- Email security concerns to maintainers
- Follow responsible disclosure practices
